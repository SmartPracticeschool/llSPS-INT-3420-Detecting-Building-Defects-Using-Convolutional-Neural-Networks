Detecting Building Defects Using Convolutional Neural  Networks
Category: Deep Learning
Description:
Detection of defects including cracks and spalls on wall surface in high-rise buildings is a crucial task of buildingsâ€™ maintenance. 
Clients are increasingly looking for fast and effective means to quickly and frequently survey and communicate the condition of their 
buildings so that essential repairs and maintenance work can be done in a proactive and timely manner before it becomes too dangerous and expensive. 
If left undetected and untreated, these defects can signi?cantly a?ect the structural integrityand the aesthetic aspect of buildings, 
timely and costeffective methods of building condition survey are of practicing need for the building owners and maintenance agencies 
to replace the time- and labour-consuming approach of manual survey.

Solution:
The proposed model has proven to be robust and able to accurately detect and localise building defects. 
The approach is being developed with the potential to scale-up and further advance to support automated detection of defects 
and deterioration of buildings in real-time using mobile devices and drones. Deep learning method of convolutional neural networks (CNN) 
in automating the condition assessment of buildings. The focus is to automated detection and localisation of key defects arising in buildings from images.
